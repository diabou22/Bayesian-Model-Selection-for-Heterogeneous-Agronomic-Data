👋 Hi, I’m @diabou22

👀 I’m passionate about sustainability and exploring how innovative approaches can help tackle the pressing challenges of our time. From renewable energy systems to responsible business practices, I’m constantly driven by the potential for positive change.

🌱 Currently pursuing a Master's in Environmental Change and Global Sustainability, I’m honing my knowledge in areas like environmental policy, sustainable development, and climate action.

💞 Looking to collaborate on projects related to Bayesian analysis, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), climate change, sustainability modelling, and sustainability reporting. If your project aligns with any of these areas, I’d love to connect and explore opportunities together.

📊 Data enthusiast with a special interest in creating clear and impactful data visualizations. Fun fact: I enjoy using R to build scatter plots and histograms—it’s like telling stories through data, bringing numbers to life to support sustainable solutions.

⚠️ Note: The app I developed only works with the loading of the analyzed data. If you need access to the data or any assistance, feel free to contact me via email!

📫 How to reach me: Drop me an email at diabou22@libero.it—I’m always open to new ideas and collaborations!
